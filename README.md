# Cattle Management System  

## Introduction  
The Cattle Management System is a proposed solution designed to enhance the management and monitoring of cattle. The system focuses on two main features: **health monitoring** and **location tracking**. The system aims to improve livestock management by providing farmers with real-time data, enabling them to make informed decisions and ensure the safety and health of their cattle. This project is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for farmers to manage their cattle efficiently.  

## Health Monitoring Feature  
The health monitoring feature allows farmers to track the well-being of each animal by recording important health data such as **temperature** and **heart rate**. By continuously monitoring these data points, the system helps identify any health abnormalities early, allowing farmers to intervene and prevent further issues.  

## Location Tracking Feature  
The location tracking feature helps monitor the movement of cattle within a designated area, ensuring that they are where they are supposed to be and preventing issues like wandering or theft. This feature utilizes technologies such as **GPS module** to provide real-time updates on the cattle's location, ensuring their safety.  

## Impact on Livestock Management  
Our system gives a solution to overcome the errors in traditional health monitoring and improve operational efficiency, enhances livestock management and ensures better productivity and animal welfare.
